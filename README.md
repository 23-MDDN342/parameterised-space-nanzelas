The name of my project is "Starry Night" and I want to design a geometric illustration with a starry night sky as an element, which is simple and easy to understand.This design was inspired by the starry sky I saw outside my window and I was reminded of Van Gogh's starry sky at the same time. But I didn't want to make a starry sky style. I wanted it to be minimalist in a way that makes each frame feel fresh.

In terms of concrete representation, I brought it out in abstract geometric form, using a kind of graphic to represent the stars, and scrolling rectangles to represent the clouds, echoing the linear clouds on Van Gogh's starry sky. At the same time increase their number of regular arrangement to present them in a textured way, simulating the movement of stars in reality through different ways of movement.

In terms of colours, my palette will be based on the shades of Van Gogh's starry sky, using mainly blue grey and yellow.

The first stage implements the basic animation flow through the code, which implements rotation and scrolling, but unsatisfactorily when I try to change the size of the canvas, it doesn't change proportionally very well. He has an element position deviation and I will try to change this error.

In the second stage, I tried to add a zoom effect to the stars in the middle row to give a richer effect to the image and fit my theme better. And solved the bug that the animation was rendered incorrectly in different resolutions that appeared in the previous phase. but I didn't use the p5 function to implement the scaling effect, which doesn't meet the code requirements. I will try to implement it with p5 function in the next stage.

In the third stage, I implemented the effect of scaling the stars using the p5.map function to make the animation more coherent. In this phase I also tried to streamline my code so that it could run the animation with high quality while still being concise.

In the final stages of finishing and beautifying the design, I feel that the original pentagon instead of a star is too minimal, and I will be replacing the original pentagon code and using a five-pointed star instead. I think this will make the animation more in line with my design intent and allow me to use more streamlined code. The final output of my animation is complete.
