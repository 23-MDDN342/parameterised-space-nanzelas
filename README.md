Sorry for changing my idea, I got a new inspiration from the starry sky and Van Gogh's stars. So for this work I will make an abstract geometric texture based on Van Gogh's starry sky. I will simulate the form of the starry sky in an abstract representation. For the colours I will be using blue, yellow and off-white.

Implemented the basic animation flow through code, implemented rotation and scrolling, and tried scaling in my own way.
